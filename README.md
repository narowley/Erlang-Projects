# Overview

The puropse of this project was to understand how to program with Erlang. While there is some similarities to what I've previously learned, there is a lot more that is new and unique to Erlang. It is a very strict language that lacks a lot of prebuilt functions, but this allows for more control over what your functions do and how they react and change. I plan on using the knowledge of how to manipulate and change functions within Erlang in my future endevours as a programmer.

To demonstrate my knowledge of Erlang, I created several programs.
* [Divisibility of factorials (facdiv.erl)](https://projecteuler.net/problem=549) - The purpose of this program is to find out the smallest factorial that is divisible by the given input. For example, the smallest factorial that 10 divides evenly into is 5!.
* Fibonacci Sequence (fibseq.erl) - This program returns the nth digit of the fibonacci sequence. For example, if 10 is inputed, the result will be 34, the 10th number of the fibonacci sequence.
* Roman Numeral Translator (roman.erl) - This program translates any number into roman numerals. If 84 is inputed, then LXXXIV is outputed.
* [Smallest Multiple (smallmult.erl)](https://projecteuler.net/problem=5) - This program finds the smallest multiple of all numbers from 1 to n. For example, if we inputed 10, we would have an output of 2520. This means that the smallest multiple of 1-10 is 2520.
* [Square the Smallest (smallsquare.erl)](https://projecteuler.net/problem=822) - This program returns the sum of a sequence from 2 to x, where the smallest number in the sequence is squared y times. For example, if x = 5 and y = 3, the sequence is from 2 to 5, with the smallest number squared 3 times. The sum of this would be 34.

As a student studying mathematics, it is important that I learn how to apply my programming language to my math skills. Through these projects, I was able to create a link between my programming background and my mathematical background as well as learn how to write comprehensive and useful programs in a new language.

# Development Environment

To develop my programs, I used Visual Studio Code. There is an erlang extension on the marketplace that was easy to download and apply to my curent workspace. I did have to download the programming language from the offical erlang website, but VSC was used for this. When I made these programs, I didn't use any external libraries. I only used the pre-packaged ones, such as lists as string.

# Useful Websites

* [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) - This website is where I recieved a lot of my inspiration for several of my programs.
* [Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/erlang/index.htm) - This is the website that I used the most to find out how this program works.
* [Erlang By Example](https://erlangbyexample.org/) - This website helped me understand the syntax used for erlang.

# Future Work

In the future, I would like to implement some changes to my programs, such as
* Find applications for several of my mathematical programs
* Allow translation from roman numerals to numbers
* Create a working for loop into my programs instead of reiteration
